# Air Hockey Game

Welcome to the Air Hockey Game! This is an interactive and engaging air hockey simulation where you can compete against an AI opponent. The game is played on a canvas element with real-time updates and smooth animation. You can choose your difficulty level, control your paddle with the keyboard, and aim to score by hitting the puck into your opponent's goal.

## Features

1. **Responsive Canvas**: 
   - The game canvas automatically resizes to fit the full screen, ensuring an optimal playing experience across different screen sizes.
   
2. **Difficulty Levels**: 
   - Three difficulty levels are available: Easy, Medium, and Bhav Level (which provides a more challenging AI opponent).
   - The difficulty impacts the AI speed, with higher levels making the game harder to win.

3. **Game Controls**: 
   - Player 1 (you) can control the paddle using `W` and `S` keys or the up (`↑`) and down (`↓`) arrow keys.
   - The AI (Player 2) automatically moves its paddle based on the puck's position.
   
4. **Real-Time Scoring**: 
   - The game tracks the score for both players, displaying it at the top of the screen.
   - When the puck enters either player's goal, the opposing player scores a point.

5. **AI Difficulty**: 
   - The AI opponent's paddle speed increases with the selected level, making it more challenging as you progress through the levels.

6. **Sound and Visual Effects**: 
   - Vibrating animations on the welcome message and smooth transitions for game interactions.
   - Real-time message updates display events such as when a player scores a goal or the game is paused.

7. **Game Start & Pause**: 
   - You can choose your difficulty level before starting the game.
   - The game will automatically pause when the level selector is shown, and you can resume playing once you make your selection.

## Game Flow

1. **Welcome Screen**: The game opens with a welcoming message and a prompt to choose a difficulty level.
2. **Gameplay**: After selecting a level, the game starts, and you control your paddle to bounce the puck and score against the AI.
3. **Scoring**: Every time a player scores, a message is shown, and the puck is reset to the center of the screen.

## Instructions

1. Select a difficulty level from the options provided: Easy, Medium, or Bhav Level.
2. Use `W` or up arrow (`↑`) to move the paddle up and `S` or down arrow (`↓`) to move it down.
3. Try to prevent the puck from getting past your paddle and aim to score by sending the puck into the opponent's goal.
4. Enjoy the challenge of trying to outplay the AI!
